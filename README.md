# ðŸ—½ New York City Taxi Trip Duration Prediction ðŸš•

![NYC Taxi Banner](Figures/header.png)

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to build a `regression model` that accurately predicts the duration of taxi trips in New York City based on historical ride data. This dataset includes pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, passenger count, and more.

This is an End-to-End ML project covering the entire workflow â€” from Data Exploration and preprocessing to feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ **Dataset**
- The dataset comes from `Kaggle` but has been preprocessed for training.  
- It consists of `1.4 million records`.  
- The dataset has:
  - `Pickup timestamps`
  - `Pickup and dropoff latitude & longitude`
  - `Passenger count`
  - `Vendor ID`
  - `Store and forward flag`
  - `Trip duration (target variable)`
- Download data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration)
- Features consists of:
  - `id:` a unique identifier for each trip.
  - `vendor_id:` a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record.
  - `pickup_datetime:` date and time when the meter was engaged.
  - `passenger_count:`  the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value).
  - `pickup_longitude:` the longitude where the meter was engaged.
  - `pickup_latitude:` the latitude where the meter was engaged.
  - `dropoff_longitude:` the longitude where the meter was disengaged.
  - `dropoff_latitude:` the latitude where the meter was disengaged.
  - `store_and_fwd_flag:` This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server, Y = store and forward, N = not a store and forward trip.
  - `trip_duration:` duration of the trip in seconds.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Goals**
- **Build models:** to estimate taxi trip duration in New York City using historical trip data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** to uncover patterns and relationships in spatial and temporal features.
- **Engineer meaningful features:** to enhance model performance, including:
  - `Haversine distance:` The Haversine distance measures the shortest distance between two points over the Earth's surface as the crow flies, taking the Earth's curvature into account.
  ```text
  def haversine_distance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2):
    lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2 = map(np.radians, (lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2))
    AVG_EARTH_RADIUS = 6371    # Average radius of Earth in kilometers
    lat = lat2 - lat1
    lng = lng2 - lng1
    d = np.sin(lat * 0.5) ** 2 + np.cos(lat1) * np.cos(lat2) * np.sin(lng * 0.5) ** 2
    distance = 2 * AVG_EARTH_RADIUS * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(d))
    return distance
  ```
  - `Manhattan distance:` Also called Taxicab distance or L1 distance, it measures how far two points are if you can only travel horizontally and vertically (like driving through a city grid).
  ```text
  def manhattan_distance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2):
    a  = np.abs(newDf['dropoff_longitude'] - newDf['pickup_longitude']) 
    b = np.abs(newDf['dropoff_latitude'] - newDf['pickup_latitude'])
    return a + b
  ```

  - `Bearing direction:` Bearing is the direction or angle from one point to another, usually measured in degrees from North (0Â°) clockwise (90Â° East, 180Â° South, etc.).
  ```text
  def bearing_direction(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2):
    AVG_EARTH_RADIUS = 6371
    lng_delta_rad = np.radians(lng2 - lng1)
    lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2 = map(np.radians, (lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2))
    y = np.sin(lng_delta_rad) * np.cos(lat2)
    x = np.cos(lat1) * np.sin(lat2) - np.sin(lat1) * np.cos(lat2) * np.cos(lng_delta_rad)
    return np.degrees(np.arctan2(y, x))
    ```
- **Extract time-based features:**
  -  `Hour of day`
  -  `Day of week`
  -  `Month`
  -  `Time of day`
  -  `Rush hour`
  -  `Holiday`


## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
To ensure high-quality input for model training, the dataset was carefully cleaned and prepared:

- **Skewness Correction:**
  - Observed that the `trip_duration` feature was right-skewed, with a long tail of very long trips.

  - Applied a logarithmic transformation (log1p) to trip_duration to normalize its distribution, improving model performance.

- **Statistical Filtering:**

  - For key numerical features, outliers were further removed by applying mean Â± 3 Ã— standard deviation (STD) thresholds, keeping only values within a statistically reasonable range.

  ```text
  mean = np.mean(newDf["log_trip_duraion"])
  std = np.std(newDf["log_trip_duraion"])
  newDf = newDf[newDf['log_trip_duraion'] <= mean + 3*std]
  newDf = newDf[newDf['log_trip_duraion'] >= mean - 3*std]
  ```

- **Outlier Removal:**

  - Removed records with extreme values in pickup and dropoff latitude/longitude coordinates, which likely represented GPS errors.

  - Detected and eliminated trips with unrealistic distances or durations (e.g., extremely long or short trips).

## ðŸ§  **Model Development**
Tried multiple regression algorithms:

  - Ridge (baseline)
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor (best performance)
